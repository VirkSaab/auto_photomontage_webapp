This project is based on the MicroSoft research paper mentioned below. Some formulas in the implemented code is different than mentioned paper.

**Overview**: This paper describes the procedure of automated digital photomontage web app. This system aims to construct an eye-pleasing image from a collection of input images without any efforts. The system constructs a montage, also known as collage, of given images using several algorithms to identify each imageâ€™s right placement. The algorithms involve saliency detection, face detection, smooth image-to-image transition, auto-orientation, and image-borders blending.
